# @thatrandomnerd69/pi-coding-agent

An opinionated, standalone Pi coding agent distribution with a small set of workflow customizations built in.

It bundles the Pi runtime and all included extensions into a single CLI, while preserving Pi's normal authentication, sessions, settings, modes, and command-line options.

## Installation

Requires Node.js 22.19 or newer.

```bash
npm install --global @thatrandomnerd69/pi-coding-agent
pi
```

A separate Pi installation is not required.

To check both the distribution build and bundled upstream Pi version:

```bash
pi --version
# @thatrandomnerd69/pi-coding-agent build 4f9c2a7d81b3 (Pi 0.84.1)
```

## Included customizations

The standalone CLI always loads five bundled extensions.

| Extension | Availability | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `bash-only` | Always | Restricts agents to bash and the coordination tools available to their role. |
| `session-workdir` | Always | Persists and restores each session's working directory. |
| `slash-command-visibility` | Always | Hides selected built-in commands from slash autocomplete. |
| `yeet` | Always | Adds `/yeet` for AI-assisted commits, pushes, and PR creation. |
| `settle` | Always | Adds `/settle` for merging or closing PRs and cleaning up branches. |

Extension entrypoints live under `extensions/<name>/index.ts`. Shared implementation modules live in `extensions/shared/` and are not separate extensions.

### Slash-command visibility

The following built-in commands are hidden from autocomplete:

`/name`, `/tree`, `/fork`, `/clone`, `/compact`, `/trust`, `/export`, `/import`, `/share`, `/hotkeys`, `/changelog`, and `/llama`.

They remain executable when entered manually.

## Custom commands

### `/yeet`

Generates GPT-5.6 Luna commit messages, feature branch names, and PR descriptions, then provides interactive commit, push, and PR automation.

Its optional **create PR + settle** flow is only available when the `settle` extension is enabled.

### `/settle [PR-number-or-URL]`

Selects one or more open GitHub pull requests, merges or closes them, and can optionally delete their local and remote branches.

Use `--dry-run` to preview the selected plan without applying it.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run check       # Type-check and run the test suite
npm run test:watch  # Run tests in watch mode
npm run coverage    # Generate text and HTML coverage reports
npm link            # Link this checkout globally
pi                # Run the linked CLI (pi-coding-agent remains as an alias)
```

Tests use Vitest with mocked Pi APIs. Command-execution tests use either mocks or disposable temporary Git repositories, so they do not modify real user repositories, sessions, branches, or pull requests.

## Publishing

Every published build uses a commit-addressed prerelease version:

```text
0.0.0-git.<12-character-commit-hash>
```

The committed manifests intentionally keep the non-publishable placeholder `0.0.0-development`. The `prepublishOnly` check runs the full test suite and rejects placeholder versions or versions whose hash does not match the current commit.

### First publication

npm Trusted Publishing cannot be configured until the package exists. Publish the first build manually from a clean, committed checkout:

```bash
npm login
test -z "$(git status --porcelain)"
version="0.0.0-git.$(git rev-parse --short=12 HEAD)"
npm version "$version" --no-git-tag-version --ignore-scripts
npm publish --tag latest --access public
```

Then configure a GitHub Actions Trusted Publisher in the package settings on npmjs.com:

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Organization or user | `thomasbrugman` |
| Repository | `pi-customizations` |
| Workflow filename | `publish.yml` |
| Allowed action | `npm publish` |

After a GitHub account rename, update both this Trusted Publisher owner and the repository URLs in `package.json`; GitHub redirects do not update npm’s OIDC trust configuration. Leave the environment name empty for this workflow. The npm package scope remains `@thatrandomnerd69`.

### Automatic publication

`.github/workflows/publish.yml` tests and publishes every push to `main` as `0.0.0-git.<12-character-commit-hash>`.

The workflow uses GitHub OIDC instead of a stored npm token, publishes provenance, marks each new build as `latest`, and safely skips commits that are already present on npm. It can also be run manually from GitHub Actions.

## Updating bundled Pi

Dependabot checks daily for new versions of `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` and `@earendil-works/pi-tui`. It groups the two packages in one pull request. The merge job requires their versions to match.

The `CI` workflow type-checks the extensions, runs the test suite, loads the CLI entrypoint, and checks the npm package contents. When that workflow passes for a patch update that changes only `package.json` and `package-lock.json`, GitHub squash-merges the tested commit and runs the publish workflow. Minor and major updates stay open for manual review because Pi is below version 1.0 and may make breaking changes in a minor release.

To update Pi manually instead, replace `<version>` with the same version for both packages:

```bash
npm install --save-exact \
  @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent@<version> \
  @earendil-works/pi-tui@<version>
npm run check
```
